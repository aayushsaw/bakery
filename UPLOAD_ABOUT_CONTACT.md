- **Changed to:** config_secure.php
- **Upload to:** `htdocs/about.php`

### 2. **contact.php**
- **Fixed:** 1 config.php reference (line 56)
- **Changed to:** config_secure.php
- **Upload to:** `htdocs/contact.php`

### Same Process as Before:

1. **Login to InfinityFree:**
   - https://dash.infinityfree.com/login

2. **File Manager:**
   - Control Panel → Files → Online File Manager

3. **Navigate to htdocs:**
   - Double-click `htdocs` folder

4. **Upload Files:**

## ✅ After Upload - Test These URLs:

1. **About Page:**
